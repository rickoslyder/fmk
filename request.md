## Technical Approach
- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) + PWA configuration (next-pwa or similar)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Offline Storage**: IndexedDB via Dexie.js
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **AI**: Claude or OpenAI API for category generation + LLM judge validation
- **Image Fetching Waterfall**: TMDB → Wikipedia/Wikidata → Google/Bing Image Search
- **Real-time (Phase 2)**: Partykit
- **Audio**: Web Audio API or Howler.js (if trivial)
- **Haptics**: Navigator.vibrate() where supported

## Phases

### Phase 1 (MVP)
- [ ] Onboarding flow (2-3 screens, skippable)
- [ ] Solo + pass-and-play modes
- [ ] Pre-built categories
- [ ] Custom AI-generated categories with validation
- [ ] Custom people lists (local storage)
- [ ] Offline support with IndexedDB caching
- [ ] Daily Challenge with admin panel
- [ ] Skip button + round history
- [ ] Quick-share links
- [ ] "Explain Yourself" UI prompt
- [ ] Optional timers
- [ ] Core drunk-proof UI
- [ ] PWA setup (installable, offline-capable)
- [ ] SFX/haptics (if trivial)

### Phase 2
- [ ] Multi-device sync via Partykit room codes
- [ ] Potential native apps via Expo
- [ ] Custom people list sync (would require optional accounts)

## Other Notes
- No user accounts required (pure guest mode)
- No image licensing concerns
- Keep branding as FMK (trust users for age-appropriateness)
- Designed primarily for personal use - minimal security/privacy overhead
- Admin panel auth: simple env-var password check
